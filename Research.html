                    <p> By understanding the behaviour of water and other liquids adjacent to complex nanoscopic surfaces, that is, surfaces with nanoscopic pattern and/or texture, I inform the design of functional advanced materials.
                    </p>
        
                    <p> My research is largely focussed towards exploring the design of non-sticky surfaces including superhydrophobic (water repellant) and oleophobic (oil-repellant) surfaces. Surface texture can transform hydrophobic surfaces into "superhydrophobic" surfaces, endowed with properties like water-repellency, self-cleaning, and fouling resistance. However, superhydrophobicity is fragile, and depends on water being excluded from the surface texture. Thus, fully realizing its promise requires an understanding of the underpinnings of wetting-dewetting transitions on nanotextured surfaces.

                    <p>  Other systems of interest to me include the design of nanoparticle membranes for desalination, and polymer electrolytes for batteries.
